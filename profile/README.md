# THistory

**_Important:_** This is a temporary README file for the GitHub organization, which will be updated and supplemented with a detailed description shortly.

This GitHub organization is created to store and maintain a single project called "THistory". The "THistory" project is aimed at storing and regularly updating the full set of messages in the history of Telegram chats. Within the THistory organization, all project-related microservices are stored, such as `thistory/api`, `thistory/frontend`, and others. A more detailed description of the organization and the project is currently being prepared and will be available soon. Stay tuned for updates.

Thank you for understanding!
